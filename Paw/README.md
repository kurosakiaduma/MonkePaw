# 🐵 MonkePaw Compiler

MonkePaw is a custom programming language that is compiled using a combination of Go and Python. The frontend of the compiler, which handles lexing and parsing, is written in Go. The Intermediate Representation (IR) is then sent to the Python backend via gRPC, where it is converted into Python code.
